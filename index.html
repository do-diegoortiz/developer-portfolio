          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to organize the project and track it constantly,
            because projects aren't just about coding, they are more about
            people and goals. Here are some tools I use:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i>Timekeeping</i> - Things need to exist in my calendar to
              happen, so I use Akiflow to keep track of my daily tasks and
              meetings
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Organisation</i> - It's important to keep the project organized
              and documented, I have used Jira, Slab and Notion. I believe it's
              very important to find documentation easily.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Communication</i> - To be on the same page is
              <strong>really important</strong> for the health of any company or
              project, so depending on the team I would use
              <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-co/" target="_blank">Slack</a>,
              <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> or
              <a
                href="https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software"
                target="_blank"
                >Teams
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Development</i> - With 9 years of experience in software
              development, I've navigated numerous challenges in this evolving
              industry. Since late 2022, AI assistants have emerged as integral
              tools in my daily tasks as a developer and entrepreneur. I
              continuously strive to stay abreast of the latest advancements in
              AI technology
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Design</i> - While I'm not a formal designer, my technical
              training in Multimedia Production has honed my ability to
              recognize and evaluate effective design. Proficient in using
              <a href="https://figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>, I can
              skillfully create and implement mock-ups, contributing
              significantly to the design process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Languages</i> - I'm a Spanish native speaker but I feel
              comfortable reading and communicating in English. I also have
              knowledge of French and Korean (한국어).
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Marketing</i> - Because I own a company, I had to learn how to
              use tools like
              <a
                href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"
                target="_blank"
                >Google Analytics</a
              >, <a href="https://adwords.google.com/">Google Ads</a>,
              <a
                href="https://www.facebook.com/business/products/ads"
                target="_blank"
                >Facebook Ads</a
              >
              and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Writing</i> - As a regular contributor to the Medellin
              Community blog and social media, I understand the significance of
              community engagement. Writing on diverse topics beyond my primary
              job role not only enriches the community but also aids in the
              continual development of my soft skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>General Knowledge</i> - I was a math champion in contests
              during high school and university. I can recall from memory every
              country along with its capital and flag. I read about economics,
              history, astronomy, physics and current news.
