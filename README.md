Hey, Iâ€™m an entrepreneur focused on software development from Colombia living in Canada. I work primarily with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

Have a look through some of my projects and [blog posts](https://alejojo23.wordpress.com/). Need help with an upcoming project or application? Check my projects, learn a bit more [about me](https://alejojo23.wordpress.com/acerca-de/) and then consider hiring me.
